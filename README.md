# OutSystems Hooks Utils

- A compilation of Cordova plugin hooks that can potentially be life-saving in your day-to-day activities. :) 

## Introduction
Cordova Hooks represent special scripts which could be added by application and plugin developers or even by your own build system to customize cordova commands.

Cordova hooks allow you to perform special activities around cordova commands. For example, you may have a custom tool that checks for code formatting in your javascript file. And, you would like to run this tool before every build. In such a case, you could use a 'before_build' hook and instruct the cordova run time to run the custom tool to be invoked before every build.

- Each folder contains specific hook to help you in your daily-development using Cordova App/Plugins on Android and iOS.
